# Application Plan: Random Forest Regressor on Boston Housing Dataset

## Project Setup
- Set up a Python environment using Poetry with necessary libraries: `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `azure-openai`, etc.
- Download the Boston Housing dataset.

## Data Preprocessing
- Load the dataset and perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- Perform basic EDA to check for missing values and identify categorical features for conversion to numerical.
- Perform feature scaling.

## Model Training
- Initialize a Random Forest Regressor model.
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
- Train the model on the training set.

## Performance Evaluation
- Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like RMSE, MAE, and RÂ².

## Integration with GPT-4 on Azure
- Set up Azure OpenAI service and authenticate.
- Define a function to send model performance metrics to GPT-4 and receive feedback on whether to proceed with hyperparameter tuning.

## Hyperparameter Tuning
- If GPT-4 suggests tuning, manually adjust hyperparameters based on GPT-4's assessment and retrain the model.

## Final Evaluation
- Evaluate the final model's performance.
- Document the results and any insights gained from the process.

## Deployment and Monitoring
